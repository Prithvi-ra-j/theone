    *   **Change:** This service will encapsulate the AI logic for the reality check:
        *   **Input:** Takes user-provided parameters (e.g., desired career, education path, location, estimated investment).
        *   **Data Retrieval:** Queries the `data_aggregator.py` for relevant salary, cost, and job market data.
        *   **LLM Prompting (LangChain):** Constructs a detailed prompt for the Ollama LLM. The prompt should include all collected data and instruct the LLM to perform a "reality check" analysis, projecting ROI, identifying challenges, and suggesting alternatives.
        *   **Example Prompt Structure:** "Given an engineering degree from [University] costing [X] in [City], with an average starting salary of [Y] for [Career], and a job market saturation of [Z], provide a realistic 5-year ROI projection, potential challenges, and alternative paths. Format the output strictly as a JSON object with keys: `roi_percentage` (float), `projected_salary_5_years` (float), `challenges` (List[str]), `alternatives` (List[str]), and `ai_summary` (str)."
        *   **Output Parsing:** Parses the LLM's JSON output to ensure structured data for the frontend.

3.  **New API Endpoint:**
    *   **File:** `backend/app/routers/career.py` (or similar, new endpoint)
    *   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/career/reality-check`
    *   **Request Body Schema:** Define a Pydantic schema `CareerRealityCheckRequest` (e.g., `career_path: str, education_level: str, location: str, investment_amount: float, investment_time_years: int`).
    *   **Response Body Schema:** Define a Pydantic schema `CareerRealityCheckResponse` (e.g., `roi_percentage: float, projected_salary_5_years: float, challenges: List[str], alternatives: List[str], ai_summary: str`).
    *   **Logic:** This endpoint will receive user inputs, call the `career_ai_service` to get the analysis, and return the structured AI response.

#### Frontend Changes (`frontend/`)

1.  **Create "Reality Check Calculator" Page/Component:**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/pages/RealityCheck.jsx` (new)
    *   **Content:**
        *   An intuitive input form for users to enter their career aspirations and financial details.

### Feature 3: Contextual Nudges & Proactive Guidance (from MemoryService)

**Goal:** Demonstrate the AI's ability to provide proactive, personalized nudges and actionable guidance based on the user's aggregated data (goals, skills, habits, mood, finance) stored in the `MemoryService`.

**Why this feature for the hackathon?**
*   **Technical Merit:** Showcases the sophisticated use of `MemoryService` (FAISS vectors) and LangChain to leverage aggregated user data for highly contextual AI responses.
*   **Innovation & Creativity:** Moves beyond reactive chatbot interactions to truly proactive, intelligent assistance, making the application feel more "alive."
*   **User Experience:** Makes the app feel deeply personalized and genuinely helpful, reinforcing the "continuous tracking" and "failure-proof planning" aspects.
*   **Alignment with Cause:** Directly supports Dristhi's vision of AI-powered guidance for smarter life decisions and continuous support.

**Actionable Steps:**

#### Backend Changes (`backend/`)

1.  **Enhance MemoryService:**
    *   **File:** `backend/app/services/memory_service.py` (existing)
    *   **Change:** Ensure `MemoryService` can effectively aggregate and retrieve *concise, relevant context* from various user modules (e.g., recent career goals, current habit streaks, last recorded mood, recent financial transactions). This might involve:
        *   Methods to fetch the most recent N data points from each module.
        *   Methods to query FAISS for semantically similar past interactions or user-defined goals.
    *   **Key:** The output of `MemoryService` should be a summarized, actionable context string or object that can be easily fed into an LLM prompt.

2.  **New AI Endpoint for Contextual Nudges:**
    *   **File:** `backend/app/routers/mini_assistant.py` (or similar, new endpoint)
    *   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/mini-assistant/nudge`
    *   **Request:** (User ID will typically be inferred from the authentication token).
    *   **Response Body Schema:** Define a Pydantic schema `NudgeResponse` (e.g., `message: str, action_suggestion: str, related_feature: str`).
    *   **Logic:**
        *   This endpoint will call a new function within `ai_service.py` (e.g., `generate_contextual_nudge`).
        *   `generate_contextual_nudge` will:
            *   Fetch the current user's context from `MemoryService` (e.g., "User's top goal is to learn Python, last mood was stressed, missed a habit streak yesterday, has a finance exam next week").
            *   Construct a prompt for the Ollama LLM using this context, along with the user's `assistant_personality` and `assistant_language` (from Feature 1).
            *   **Example Prompt Structure:** "Given the user's current context: [summarized context from MemoryService], provide a short, encouraging, and actionable nudge. If appropriate, suggest a specific feature within the app to use. Keep the tone consistent with a [user's chosen personality] personality and in [user's chosen language]. Format as JSON with keys: `message`, `action_suggestion`, `related_feature`."
            *   Parse the LLM's JSON output to extract the structured nudge.

3.  **Scheduled Task (Optional but impactful for a "proactive" feel):**
    *   **File:** `backend/app/tasks/scheduler.py` (new, if using Celery or similar for background tasks)
    *   **Change:** Implement a periodic task that, for active users, calls the `GET /api/v1/mini-assistant/nudge` endpoint. For a hackathon, simply having the endpoint callable by the frontend is sufficient to demonstrate the concept. If time permits, storing these nudges in a temporary cache or pushing them via WebSockets would enhance the real-time feel.

#### Frontend Changes (`frontend/`)

1.  **Mini Assistant Component (Enhanced):**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/components/MiniAssistant.jsx` (existing)
    *   **Change:**
        *   Implement a mechanism to periodically (e.g., every 5-10 minutes, or triggered by specific user actions like navigating to the dashboard) call the `GET /api/v1/mini-assistant/nudge` endpoint.
        *   Display the `message` from the nudge response within the Mini Assistant's speech bubble.
        *   If `action_suggestion` and `related_feature` are provided, make them interactive (e.g., a clickable button or link) that navigates the user to the suggested feature/page within the application.
    *   **UI/UX:** Ensure nudges are non-intrusive but noticeable. Consider subtle animations, a change in the assistant's icon, or a small notification badge on the assistant.

2.  **API Integration (Frontend):**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/api/miniAssistant.js` (new)
    *   **Change:** Add a function to make the API call to `GET /api/v1/mini-assistant/nudge`.
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/hooks/useMiniAssistantNudges.js` (new, if using React Query)
    *   **Change:** Implement a custom React hook to manage the polling/triggering of nudge requests and the dynamic display of the current nudge.
