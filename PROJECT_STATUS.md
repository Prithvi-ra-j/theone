🆕 Recent Updates — 2025‑10‑02
- Assistant page upgraded to a ChatGPT‑like experience: streaming responses, animated bubbles, copy/regenerate, auto‑resizing composer, scroll‑to‑bottom helper, and collapsible Tools bar.
- Sessions sidebar added with “New chat”; fixed a navigation bug causing blank page; all interactive buttons now use explicit types to prevent accidental submits.
- Tooling wired end‑to‑end: mood.log and finance.create_income tools available via catalog and a simple execution modal; results are persisted as assistant messages.
- Chat management: per‑session Delete (trash icon) and Delete all chats; new backend endpoints for bulk delete and delete‑all interactions.
- Simplifications: removed floating mini assistant widget and the Animation Demo page; hid avatar controls in Assistant Builder.
- Greeting quality: improved backend streaming handler to detect short greetings and return a warm, actionable intro with suggestions and a tip, with graceful fallback when AI is unavailable.

📌 Hackathon Plan Progress (80 → 95)

Technical Merit
- [x] Health dashboard endpoint (/api/v1/healthz) returns db, ai {available, model}, faiss {ok, index_count}, version, uptime
- [x] E2E happy‑path test: create goal → converse with AI → start learning path (tests added)
- [x] Mini RAG pipeline: retrieve top 3 snippets and include “Context used” footnote
- [x] Observability basics: request_id (X‑Request‑ID), structured access logs, JSON metrics (/api/v1/metrics)
- [x] Reliability guardrails: AI timeouts and template fallback; no hard 500s on AI outages in chat path

User Experience
- [x] Onboarding wizard: multi‑step, saves to user preferences, used later
- [x] Enforce AI advice template (server‑side) with markdown sections
- [ ] Roadmap export/share (print‑to‑PDF stylesheet + share link)
- [ ] UX polish: skeletons, better empty states, tooltips, focus/aria

Alignment with Cause
- [x] Internship/Hackathon feed under /api/v1/opportunities with filters
- [ ] Local learning “Starter Packs” per skill (curated links)

Innovation & Creativity
- [ ] Peer benchmarking mock (sample percentile + badge)
- [ ] Gamification nudge (daily streaks, celebratory toast)
- [ ] Reality Check Plus chart (static heuristic chart)

Market Feasibility
- [ ] Freemium mock (pricing modal: Free vs Premium)
- [ ] Campus GTM plan (+ “College Mode” flag)
- [ ] Open‑source edge (README notes on localizable JSON + language roadmap)
