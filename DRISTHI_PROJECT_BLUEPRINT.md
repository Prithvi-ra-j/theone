- Karma system for helping others.  
- Achievements inspired by India (ISRO Badge, IIT streak).  

### 🎭 Mini Assistant (New)

- Contextual nudges:  
  - “🔥 You usually revise at 7 PM — shall I remind you?”  
  - “🎓 2 hrs till exam, breathe and review last 3 questions.”  

### 🧩 Assistant Builder (Onboarding Game)  
- Step 1 → Choose **Avatar** (🪔 Diya, 🧑‍🏫 Mentor, 🤖 Robot, 🐯 Animal).  
- Step 2 → Pick **Personality** (🎓 Mentor, ⚡ Motivator, 🧘 Calm Guide, 😎 Chill Buddy).  
- Step 3 → Select **Language Style** (English, Hindi, Hinglish, Tamil, etc).  
- Step 4 → Preview → “👋 Namaste Arjun! I’m your buddy and I’ll help you hit your goals.”  
- Step 5 → Confirm → Assistant persists into daily dashboard.  

### 🌟 Future Assistant Features
- Evolves with you (levels up as your streak grows).  
- Special festive avatars (Diwali = glowing diya, Holi = colorful buddy).  
- Can suggest **instant AI actions** (summarize notes, quick motivation, ROI check).
